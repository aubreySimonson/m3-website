              Musicraft is a VR audio-visual gaming experience and platform where
              the user creates and remixes music and architecture at the same time.
              It explores the idea that architecture is frozen music and music is
              flowing architecture.
            </p>
            <p class = "projecttext">
              In this experience, users are able to generate their own large-scale
              architectures by freely interacting with the blocks. Meanwhile, audios
              are presented in a synaesthetic way. Different interaction choice of user
              leads to different visual output. Each music rhythm, respective building
              block as a tableau, and the composing of which illustrates a dynamic,
              non-linear, unpredictable, potentially infinite structure. Music, composition,
              special effects—everything, down to an open experience allowing a non-musician,
              non-3D builder, or non-visual artist to create their own piece.
              We look forward to checking out users’ composition of music and architecture
              through their constant imagination and experiments and uncovering what’s
              possible in the remix of both in Musicraft.

            For our Final project our group decided to create a sequencer that
            interacted with the music inside of the environment. Along with playing
            around with sounds inside of our world, we wanted our user to get a taste
            of what it is like to travel across the globe. Inside of our project,
            the user will be introduced to different environments and music.
            In turn the player will be invited to play around with the objects they see.
            Our goal is for the user to create music with the items in front of them.
            We want our player to leave the experience with a feeling of satisfaction
            and an intrigue to continue exploring parts of the world and composition.

            StageFright is a Mixed Reality app aiming to help performing musicians
            deliver more confident and relaxed performances in person. It provides a
            VR performance venue environment for the user to play their instrument in,
            as well as a waiting room and backstage area to simulate the full experience
            of preparing for a performance. The app offers helpful reminders and provides
            research-based CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) techniques to help the user relax.
            These are triggered by biometric sensors that detect change in the user’s sweat level.
            The user experience is as follows:
            (waiting room → backstage → performance stage → waiting room).
            This process introduces and assists the musician with
            1) getting comfortable rehearsing in the venue and
            2) using biometric feedback to help the performer regulate their anxiety levels
            through visual and auditory guidance.

            “Aura” is a meditative, immersive VR experience that is (hopefully)
            aesthetically pleasing and heart-warming. In the story, the protagonist
            is a snow spirit, and collects aura (mystic particles) to orchestrate
            an aurora show at night. The scene will be an interactive experience
            where the player/snow spirit ingests aura stored in a magic tank, in an
            arctic setting. In the end, as the player ingests/interacts with the aura
            coming out of the tank, they will orchestrate an aurora show in the night
            sky with audio and visual elements.

            In virtual reality, music becomes technology: what we can hear and perceive as music is controlled
            entirely by what we can electronically synthesize, produce, and generate. This opens up worlds of
            possibility for the creation of new forms of music making, catalyzed by increased opportunities for radical
            collaboration, experimentation with neurological and physical laws, and a soundscape that has yet to be
            defined. Our project, Tone Soup, introduces an intuitive gestural interface to foster this sort of intense
            musical exchange and experimentation. Through collective user input, our VR experience will help
            compose the “folk music” of the metaverse from folk narratives of what it means for music—and
            technology—to be live.
